<h3 style="text-align: left;">This conversation is framed around three questions: </h3>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">What are some of the affordances that you believe the PhD has given you, or gives to others, generally?</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">For you, what were some of the opportunity costs of going for the PhD?</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">What are the top one or two pieces of advice that you would share with someone who wants a career in science/research/data, but doesnâ€™t necessarily know if they want to pursue the PhD?</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
