# This conversation is framed around three questions:
- What are some of the affordances that you believe the PhD has given you, or gives to others, generally?
- For you, what were some of the opportunity costs of going for the PhD?
- What are the top one or two pieces of advice that you would share with someone who wants a career in science/research/data, but doesnâ€™t necessarily know if they want to pursue the PhD?
